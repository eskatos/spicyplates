# Spicy Plates

Spicy Plates ease the use of templating engines for simple use cases supporting Velocity, StringTemplate and eRuby templates.

Boilerplate code is provided to use templates from simple strings, classpath resources, webapp resources or files.

Webapp support can be used through Servlets or Filters.

Several artifacts allow you to choose what templating engine:

* spicyplates-velocity
* spicyplates-stringtemplate
* spicyplates-eruby
* spicyplates-multi allow mixing template types in a single application

The project is hosted in maven central.
